# Fuel & Lift: setup

About an hour, once. You create the accounts and paste a few keys; everything else is in this folder.

What you end up with: the app on your own link, sign-in by email code (Google optional), each person's logs private to them and synced between phone and laptop, and Claude reading entries through a server function that holds your API key and caps use per person per day.

## Quick setup (recommended)

Create the Supabase project (step 1.1 below), a Supabase access token (Supabase → Account → Access Tokens) and an Anthropic API key (step 2.1). Then one command does everything else in steps 1 and 2:

```
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... node supabase/deploy.mjs fuel-lift
```

It runs the database script, deploys the `claude` function with its secrets, sets up email-code sign-in for the app's address, and writes `config.js`. Commit `config.js`, then do step 3 (hosting). You can delete the access token afterwards.

The manual steps below do the same thing by hand.

## 1. Supabase project (database + sign-in)

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). Pick the region closest to you (Mumbai for India).
2. **SQL Editor → New query**: paste all of [`../supabase/schema.sql`](../supabase/schema.sql) and run it.
3. **Project Settings → API**: copy the **Project URL** and the **anon public** key into [`config.js`](config.js).
4. **Authentication → Emails → Magic Link** template: add a line with the code, e.g.
   `<p>Your sign-in code: <b>{{ .Token }}</b></p>`
   An app installed on the iPhone home screen can't receive links opened in Safari, so the code is what signs you in there.
5. **Authentication → URL Configuration**: set **Site URL** to your app's address (step 3) and add the same address under **Redirect URLs**.

## 2. Claude (the server function)

1. At [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com): create an API key, add billing, and set a **monthly spend limit** (Settings → Limits).
2. In Supabase, **Edge Functions → Deploy a new function → Via editor**. Name it `claude`, paste [`../supabase/functions/claude/index.ts`](../supabase/functions/claude/index.ts) and deploy.
   (With the Supabase CLI instead: `supabase functions deploy claude` from the repo root.)
3. **Edge Functions → Secrets**: add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Optional:
   - `DAILY_CAP`: Claude actions per person per day (default 30)
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: your app's address, so only your page can call the function
   - `MODEL_SMART` / `MODEL_QUICK`: default `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-haiku-4-5`
   - `APP_TIMEZONE`: when the daily cap resets (default `Asia/Kolkata`)
4. Check it: sign in to the app, open **Profile → Account**. "Claude: Connected" means the function and key work; anything else names the problem.

Until this is done the app still works: the built-in food table (130 foods), your saved foods, water, weight and editing all run without Claude. Set `CLAUDE: false` in `config.js` to hide the Claude features until then.

## 3. Hosting

Any static host works: upload the `fitness` folder.
- **Vercel or Netlify**: drag and drop the folder, and you get a link like `fuel-lift.vercel.app`.
- **GitHub Pages**: this repo is public, so turning on Pages (Settings → Pages → deploy from branch) serves it at `https://harshith017.github.io/sri-lanka-trip-app/fitness/`.

Open the link on your phone, then Share → **Add to Home Screen**.

## 4. Optional

- **Google sign-in**: in Google Cloud, create an OAuth client (Web) with redirect URI `https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. Paste its client ID and secret into Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google, then set `GOOGLE_SIGN_IN: true` in `config.js`.
- **Invite-only Claude**: add friends' emails in the `invites` table (Table Editor). While the table is empty, anyone who signs up can use Claude up to the daily cap. Once it has rows, only those emails can.
- **1,014 Indian recipes**: download `INDB.xlsx` from the INDB project, then Profile → *Import 1,014 Indian recipes*. They then log instantly without Claude.

## What it costs

Hosting and Supabase are free at friend-group scale. Claude is pay-as-you-go:

| Action | Model | About |
|---|---|---|
| Food / gym / health entry, photo | Sonnet 5 | $0.01–0.02 |
| Sport session with coach questions | Sonnet 5 | $0.03 |
| Next-session plan, weekly review | Sonnet 5 | $0.02–0.03 |
| Blood-test report (PDF) | Sonnet 5 | $0.04 |
| Meal ideas, sport questions | Haiku 4.5 | under $0.01 |
| Food already in the table or saved foods | none | free |

That comes to roughly $3–5 a month for someone who logs every day, and under $1 for a light user. Food entries use Sonnet rather than Haiku because food estimates are where accuracy matters most. Set `MODEL_SMART=claude-haiku-4-5` to halve the cost.

## Checking it works

- `node --test fitness/calc.test.js` runs the unit tests for all the maths and the food table.
- In the app, the dot after the logo shows sync: green is saved, amber is saving, grey is offline (still saved on the phone), red is retrying.
